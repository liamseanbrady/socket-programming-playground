## A basic chat server implemented in Ruby

If you want to try this out on your local machine, do the following:

- cd into the directory where chat_server.rb is.
- Run 'ruby chat_server.rb' in the terminal.
- This will run the server on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) at port 2000 by default.
- Open another terminal window and do 'telnet 127.0.0.1 2000'. This is your first chatroom member
- Open a third terminal window and do the same as the step above. This is your second chatroom member.
- Have a conversation with yourself.

Fun times.
